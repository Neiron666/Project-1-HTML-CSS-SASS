                    <h2>Celebration</h2>
                    <p class="textAbout">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in southern Louisiana, including the
                        city of New Orleans. Celebrations are
                        concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                        (the start of lent in
                        the Western Christian tradition). Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, but the season actually
                        begins on Kings Day
                        (12th Night), January 6th, and extends until midnight before Ash Wednesday. Club, or Krewe,
                        balls start soon after,
                        though most are extremely private, with their Kings and Queens coming from wealthy old families
                        and their courts
                        consisting of the seasons debutantes. Most of the high society Krewes do not stage parades. As
                        Fat Tuesday gets nearer,
                        the parades start in earnest. Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting);
                        many days have several
                        large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
                        Gras season. In the
                        final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including
                        parades and balls (some of
                        them masquerade balls).</p>

                    <h2>Early history</h2>
                    <p class="textAbout">The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth
                        of the Mississippi River in what is now
                        lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                        celebrated it as part of an
                        observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New
                        Orleans is unknown. A 1730
                        account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming
                        (including cross-dressing).
                        An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and
                        wearing of masks in the
                        streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly
                        renewed whenever such
                        restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

                        In 1833, Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent
                        raised money to fund an
                        official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other
                        Miscellaneous Pieces
                        describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835</p>

                    <h2>21st centuries</h2>
                    <p class="textAbout">In 1979, the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades
                        were canceled or moved to surrounding
                        communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came
                        to the city. Masking,
                        costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order.
                        Guardsmen prevented crimes
                        against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use;
                        for these reasons, some
                        in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

                        In 1991, the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations,
                        including Mardi Gras
                        Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion,
                        gender or sexual orientation,
                        to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.Shortly after the law was passed, the
                        city demanded that these
                        krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy
                        and the distinctly
                        private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it
                        jurisdiction to demand
                        otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading.
                        Proteus did parade in
                        the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade
                        schedule in 2000.

                    <h2>Effects "Katrina"</h2>
                    <p class="textAbout">The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a few
                        people to question the future of the city's
                        Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried to play
                        this sentiment for
                        electoral advantage[citation needed]. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too
                        important to the city's
                        revival.

                        The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back
                        celebration to limit strains
                        on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to
                        parade, so negotiations
                        between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule. It was scaled back
                        but less severely than
                        originally suggested.</p>

                    <h2 class="mayorNOrleanH2">Mayor of New Orleans</h2>
                    <p class="textAbout1">LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician
                        serving as the Mayor of New Orleans,
                        Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before
                        becoming mayor, Cantrell
                        represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018</p>
                    <h3>Political Career</h3>

                    <p class="special-p">In 2012, Cantrell declared her candidacy for the New Orleans City Council seat
                        vacated when former District B
                        representative Stacy Head won an election to an at-large position. After the November election,
                        candidate Dana Kaplan
                        and Cantrell advanced to a December runoff, which Cantrell won with 54 percent of the vote.
                        Cantrell served out the
                        balance of Head's term, and was unopposed for a full four-year term in 2014.

                        As a council member, Cantrell focused on health, housing, and criminal-justice issues. She
                        introduced a bill banning
                        smoking at restaurants and bars within New Orleans, citing the health effects of secondhand
                        smoke on service industry
                        workers.The council unanimously passed the bill in 2015.

                        Also in 2015, Cantrell began work to open a low-barrier homeless shelter, a move that was
                        objected to by residents
                        because of its proposed placement in Central City, New Orleans. Instead, the shelter was moved
                        to the downtown site of
                        the former VA Hospital. In 2017, Cantrell introduced legislation with at-large council
                        member Jason Williams to
                        register and inspect rental units in the city.

                        As a member of the Criminal Justice Committee, Cantrell has participated in efforts to install
                        crime cameras in her
                        district, assess the effectiveness of citywide anti-gun-violence campaigns, and address
                        understaffing at the New Orleans
                        Police Department.<br><br>Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to
                        hold the position in the city's history.[28] Once
                        in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a
                        strategic plan to address
                        families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked
                        with finding solutions to
                        violent crime.[29] Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city for
                        city use, Cantrell has
                        focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation,
                        public parks, and green
                        spaces.[30] As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit
                        against four opioid
                        manufacturers and distributors.

                        During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share
                        Agreement with Governor John
                        Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront
                        funding for the city's
                        infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city.
                        Following the approval of the
                        Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City
                        Council put on the ballot
                        in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term
                        rental properties, as
                        well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
